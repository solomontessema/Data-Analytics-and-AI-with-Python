# 🧠 Data Analytics & AI with Python

Welcome to the official repository for **Data Analytics and AI with Python**, a hands-on course designed by Solomon Tessema to bridge foundational analytics with modern agentic AI workflows. This repo blends classical machine learning, PySpark-based data engineering, and LLM integration into reproducible, real-world pipelines.

---

## 🚀 Course Objectives

- Master Python for data analysis, visualization, and automation
- Build scalable ETL pipelines using **PySpark**
- Apply classical ML techniques: regression, classification, clustering
- Integrate **LLMs** and vector search for intelligent data workflows
- Design modular, observable systems using **n8n**, **LangChain**, and custom APIs
